## Computational Chemistry Course

I was the only graduate student in a Computational Chemistry course aimed at advanced undergraduate students,
in their junior and senior years of chemistry studies at Fordham. 

I learned a ton from the class, both about chemistry and computing. 
I was not the TA, but as the resident CS grad student there were a few times I got to share my love of computing with the class. 

Here are a few slide decks I put together. 

### Very brief intro to RL 

The aim of this presentation is to jumpstart CompChem student's interest and understanding of RL basics and empower them to jump in!

### RL Continued: MCTS

A few weeks later, we covered [compter-aided chemical synthesis planning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201506101). 
A lot of cool tree search algorithms have been employed in this space, including [MCTS](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25978)
